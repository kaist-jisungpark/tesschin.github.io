2. Memo:

   **Problem**
   
      Conversational Agent의 문제를 해결하기 위해 Human Speech functional Rule을 가져오려고 하지만, 
      Human-Agent와의 long-term relationship을 위해서는 Conversation의 key 특성을 이해할 필요가 있음.
      
   **Objects of research**
 
      * We aim to understand what people value in conversation and how this should manifest in agents.
        (1) what characteristics people see as important in conversation,
        (2) how these vary when applied to conversations with artificial agents.
        
  **What they did**
   
      They achieve this by presenting the results of 17 semi-structured interviews on people’s understandings and 
      expectations of conversations with people and agents
   
   **Findings**
   
      * Two broad purposes for conversation: Social Purposes & Transactional purposes.  
        - Transaction purpose: more goal-oriented. gather information. 
     
      *  the principle use-case of the CA was ‘handsfree’, meaning that an alternative primary task, rather than the conversation,
         was the focus of attention. (★★★★)
