1. Title & Reference: 

   Brixey, J., & Novick, D. (2019). Building rapport with extraverted and introverted agents. In *Advanced Social Interaction with Agents* (pp. 3-13). Springer, Cham.

2. Objective: 

   This study examines if humans will report greater rapport when interacting with an agent with an extroversion/introversion profile similar to their own.

3. Memo: 

   * our results suggest that the best option would be an extraverted personality, as both introverts and extraverts reported higher levels of rapport with an extroverted agent than introverted

   * introverts did not show preference for either agent. 

   * introverts reported the lowest level of rapport when interacting with the introverted agent 

   * Results suggest that subjects did not report the greatest rapport when interacting with the agent most similar to their level of extraversion.
