3. Memo:
   ****Problem****
      Conversation is becoming a key mode of human-computer interaction. However,there is no sense of how such interfaces are used in
       everyday life.
   ****Objects of research**** 
 
      *  Findings of interviews with 14 users of CAs in an effort to understand the current interactional factors affecting everyday use
      *  Two key questions
         (a) what factors currently motivate and limit the ongoing use of CAs in everyday life
         (b) what should we consider in future design iterations?
   ****What they did****
      They present the findings of 14 semi-structured interviews conducted with existing users of CA systems and, 
      on the basis of their analysis, present four key areas where current systems fail to support effective user interaction
   ****Findings****
      *  The tasks reported were relatively simple; checking upcoming weather followed by reminders.
      *  all participants described making use of a particular economy of language. (어려운 단어를 쓰지 않거나, 일부러 쉽게 말하기 등) 
      *  majority were unlikely to engage in conversational-style interactions when in public 
         (in private 일때는 Personal한 Tone으로 말할 수도 있지만 in public에서는 direct하게 명령함) 
      *  CA were considered an entertaining/gimmicky addition to their device rather than a key application. 
         (주요 기능이라기 보다는 entertaining이나 추가 기능 정도로 인식)
      *  families with small children (3 participants), Siri and Cortana were a particular source of entertainment (어린이 사용 많음)
      *  once the amusement had passed, levels of engagement dipped and the framing of Siri as a fallible 
         but amusing tool pervaded much of the narrative (오락적인 부분에 대한 재미가 떨어지면 engagement가 떨어짐)
      *  When Siri failed to perform a key task more than a few times (reportedly between 2 and 6 in the majority of cases),
         user expectations were set (2-6번 정도의 key task fail 경험으로, expectation이 setting됨)
      *  the principle use-case for the CA was ‘hands free’, which was tied strongly to the theme of (★★★★)
         timesaving and convenience (a) hands were necessarily otherwise engaged (b) hands were dirty (c) the handset couldn’t be easily reached, 
         (d) speech was felt to be faster, or (b) when attention was distributed, particularly during another primary activity 
      *  Participants made the CA their principal focus only when engaging it in playful interactions, 
         or during preparatory or exploratory work/activities such as experimenting/teaching it/testing the limits of its capability
         Most useful during activities that demanded high attentional resources such as cycling, driving, or looking after children
      *  Users viewed their CA principally as a simple task-based system and, they did not attempt complex tasks 
         (a) Simple Task: check the weather, setting reminders, setting alarms, getting directions, making lists, adding notes, 
              adding items to their calendar, searching the Internet, searching their address book, activating music playlists
         (b) Complex Task: launching a call or sending a long email (mostly considered tasks with which the CA could not be trusted)
      *  They did not know what their CA could do. 
      *  Specific factors limiting interaction included a lack of understanding of 
          (a) what the system could do, (b) what it was doing (c) how it was doing it, (d) whether or not its capabilities altered 
              over time, and (e) the extent to which that alteration was a direct result of user interaction
      *  Users were more technically knowledgeable, their expectations were relatively modest and they tended to be more forgiving
         when the CA failed (기술적인 정보가 많을수록, agent 실수에 관대함) 
      *  those who reported less technical knowledge were found to use both gendered pronouns and greater anthropomorphism in 
         their descriptions (기술적인 정보가 적을수록 의인화 경향을 보임) 
      *  ****CAs were found to fail to live up to initial user expectations****
      *  the issue of required precision was a factor linked to trust and reliability
      *  visual confirmation that complex tasks had been carried out accurately (복잡한 Task에 대해서는 Visual Confirmatioin을 원함)
      *  의인화 요소는 유저의 기대치를 높임. playful/humorous interactions had the effect of reinforcing anthropomorphic qualities
         (유머는 의인화 요소를 더 강화함)
      *  the principle use-case of the CA was ‘handsfree’, meaning that an alternative primary task, rather than the conversation,
         was the focus of attention. (★★★★)
      *  the activity was not only hands free but required a level of visual attention (화면 dictation)
      *  deep ‘gulf of evaluation'
