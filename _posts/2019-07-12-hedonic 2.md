I. Title & Reference: 

Microcomputer Playfulness: Development of a Measure with Workplace Implications Author(s): Jane Webster and  Joseph J. Martocchio Source: MIS Quarterly, Vol. 16, No. 2 (Jun., 1992), pp. 201-226  (1342회 인용)



II. Objective of research 

* The purpose of this article is to begin to develop a valid microcomputer playfulness measure and to demonstrate its implications for both MIS practice and research

* It develops hypotheses explaining relationships of microcomputer playfulness with other individual difference characteristics and with training outcomes, such as positive mood, satisfaction, and learnin



III. Major Findings: 

1. Generally, we found that microcomputer playfulness relates positively with computer attitudes, computer competence, and computer efficacy, and with outcomes such as involvement, positive mood, satisfaction, and learning
2.  microcomputer playfulness relates inversely with computer anxiety. 
3. no relationship between microcomputer playfulness and either gender or age. 
4.  microcomputer playfulness may represent a more efficient predictor of involvement, positive mood, satisfaction, and learning
5. microcomputer playfulness represents a potentially important individual attribute whose influence should be examined in future research on human-computer interactions 
6. microcomputer playfulness is a relatively stable characteristic (i.e., it cannot be changed in a training context), organizations may measure microcomputer playfulness and adopt different training programs for those with high and low microcomputer playfulness



IV. Findings: 

* Trait과 States의 차이: traits refer to comparatively stable characteristics of individuals that are relatively invariant to situational stimuli. States, on the other hand, refer to affective or cognitive episodes that are experienced in the short run and fluctuate over time. Unlike general traits, states can be influenced by situational factors and the interaction between the person and the situation

* The general trait of playfulness depicts a multi faceted construct encompassing five distinct factors: cognitive spontaneity, social spontaneity, physical spontaneity, manifest joy, and sense of humor.

* Higher playfulness results in immediate subjective experiences like involvement, positive mood, and satisfaction 

* cognitive spontaneity represents the most relevant playfulness factor in the context of human-computer interaction

* **more playful individuals are more likely to examine the options available on the user menu and experiment with them**

* are more likely to have mastered the software and to exhibit more positive attitudes toward the software 

* a high level of cognitive spontaneity indicates a high degree of playfulness and a low level of cognitive spontaneity indicates a low degree of playfulness

* Computer Attitude: individuals higher in microcomputer playfulness will also demonstrate more positive attitudes..

* Researchers have argued that attitudes toward computers have important effects on the usage and ultimate success or failure of computer systems.

* those individuals who interact more playfully with microcomputers may develop more positive attitudes toward them.

* Computer anxiety is defined as "the tendency of individuals to be uneasy, apprehensive, or fearful about current or future use of computers. computermanics are much more likely to interact playfully with microcomputers than are computerphobic

* Computer Competence: users higher in microcomputer playfulness will demonstrate higher competence with computers.

* Computer Efficacy Belief:  Self-efficacy is defined as one's beliefs in one's ability to perform a specific task

* Computer efficacy will be positively associated with microcomputer playfulness 

* This research implies that employees higher in the trait of microcomputer playfulness will ex perience higher involvement in the computer interaction, higher positive mood, and higher satisfaction with the training

* individuals who scored higher in microcomputer playfulness were more likely to report positive affect and satisfaction during computer interactions and to score higher in tests of learning at the end of training sessions

* employees higher in microcomputer playfulness will view microcomputer interactions more positively than less playful employees and consequently will be more motivated to engage in micro computer interactions in the future

* negative effects of playfulness, such as longer time to task completion (Sandelands, 1988) and over involvement

* that individuals who are more playful with micro computers will learn more quickly or may evaluate new systems more thoroughly because they experiment more

* Recent empirical research on adults indicates that the general characteristic of playfulness relates **positively to individual creativity** and to **more exploratory behaviors** during interactions with tasks. 

* Generally, we found that **microcomputer playfulness relates positively with computer attitudes,** **computer competence, and computer efficacy, and with outcomes such as involvement, positive mood, satisfaction, and learning** 

* microcomputer playfulness relates inversely with computer anxiety.  

* no relationship between microcomputer playfulness and either gender or age.  

* microcomputer playfulness may represent a more efficient predictor of involvement, positive mood, satisfaction, and learning 

* microcomputer playfulness represents a **potentially important individual attribute** whose influence should be examined in future research on human-computer interactions

* microcomputer playfulness is a relatively stable characteristic (i.e., it cannot be changed in a training context), organizations may measure microcomputer playfulness and adopt different training programs for those with high and low microcomputer playfulness
